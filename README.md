# wincmd


wincmd.exe is a simple program that I use to get windows make (via makefile) to launch the cmd window (the command line shell).

Make automatically captures the cmd window as stdin which doesn't help when you want access to and interact with the cmd window.

So, this is a little window app which just passes paramaters straight to cmd.

When the cmd shell is closed, this app will close automatically also.

Coded and built in: Watcom v2 in WinXP.
